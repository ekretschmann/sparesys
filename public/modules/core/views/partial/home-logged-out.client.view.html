            Of course it is! But you don't have to be one to use Rememberators. Kids are the people, who
            spend
            much
            of
            their time learning, so we are trying to make this site attractive for them.
            If
            you
            are
            grown up, just go with the flow and learn like a child.

            Yes, it is and it will be for using it for the future. We believe that a tool that is
            designed
            to help young learners to succeed in school should be free of charge. We are looking into
            enabling contributors of content to take a charge, but we are not going to restrict any
            of the functionality.

            Spaced repetition tools are great, but they expect you to do your chores every day.
            Remembarators adapts to you and your learning
            style.
            Whether you repeat your cards every day, or you are just coming back from a break. We call it maximum gain repetition.

            You can create your own stacks of cards just for yourself. If you feel like it,
            you can make them publically accessible. When you enroll in a public course, you
            work on your local copy, where you can add cards or edit them as you wish.

            Some things are easier to remember than others. Why waste time repeating things often
            that are easy to remember anyway? Rememberators keep track on what
            people remember easily and asks these cards less often.

        <infobox logo="philosopher" title="How mature is this application?" position="left">
            Rememberators are still is in their alpha stage. We have a number of users now and will
            include
            their feedback in future versions of the application. The application is open for early
            adopters,
            but
            at this stage we are after organic growth and are not advertising the application for a
            wide audience. But stay tuned, a beta release is planned for early 2016.
