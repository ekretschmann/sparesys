                            New to Rememberators? I see, that you haven't got any courses, yet.
                            Whatever you learn on Rememberators is put into courses. Courses help you to
                            keep the subjects you learn separated so that you can concentrate on one thing
                            at a time. So how to you get your courses?

                            Superheros sometimes <a href="#!/courses/create">create their own courses</a>. This is great
                            when you have
                            something special that you find interesting. Why not have your very own
                            course on horse breeds or facts about your favorite football stars? Once you
                            have created a course you can decide to publish it and share it with others here
                            on Rememberators - or you can keep it for yourself forever. Use the Courses
                            Menu to get going!

                            Rememberators are also great for your teachers. They let them put courses together for
                            you and help you learn your facts. This way, they can spot what you are working on
                            and give you all the support that you need to succeed. If your school works with the
                            Rememberators, you can use the courses menu to <a
                                href="#!/schools/subscribe/student">find</a>
                            your school and enrol. Your teachers will then be able to assign your coursework.
