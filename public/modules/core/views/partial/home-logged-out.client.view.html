        <infobox logo="girl" title="Is this site for kids?" position="left">
            Of course it is! But you don't have to be one to use Rememberators. Kids are the people, who
            spend
            much
            of
            their time learning, so we want this site to be attractive to them.
            If
            you
            are
            grown up, just go with the flow and learn like a child.

        <infobox logo="boy" title="Is it for free?" position="left">
            Yes, it is and it will be for the foreseeable future. We believe that a tool designed
            to help young learners succeed in school should be free of charge.

            Spaced repetition tools are great, but they expect you to do your chores every day.
            Rememberators adapts to you and your learning
            style.
            Whether you repeat your cards every day, or are just coming back from a break. We call it maximum gain repetition.

    <div class="info-card">
        <infobox logo="man" title="Public courses - Private copies" position="left">
            You can create your own stacks of cards just for yourself. If you feel like it,
            you can make them publicly accessible. When you enroll in a public course, you
            work on your local copy, where you can add cards or edit them as you wish.

        <infobox logo="girl" title="Rememberators learn about your learning" position="left">
            Some things are easier to remember than others. Why waste time repeating things often
            that are easy to remember anyway? Rememberators keep track of what
            people remember easily and asks these cards less often.

            Rememberators is still in its alpha stage. We are currently
            including
            test user feedback. Rememberators is open for early
            adopters,
            but
            at this stage we are not advertising the application to a
            wide audience. But stay tuned, a beta release is planned for 2016.
