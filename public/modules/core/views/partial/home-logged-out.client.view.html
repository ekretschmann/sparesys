    <div class="sparesys-title">Is this site for kids?</div>
    <div>
        Of course it is, but you don't have to be one to use Rememberators. Kids are the people, who spend much of
        their time learning, so we are trying to make this site as attractive as possible for them. If you are
        grown up or the games and animations get into your way, you will be able to switch them off.

<div class="sparesys-header" style="padding-top: 20px;">
    <div class="sparesys-title">Is it for free?</div>
    <div>
        Yes, it is. And we guarantee no charges for all functionality.

    <div class="sparesys-title">Rememberators optimize your learning</div>

    <div>
        Spaced repetition tools are great, but they expect you to do your chores every day.
        Remembarators does not have this unrealistic expectation and adapts to you and your learning style,
        whether you repeat your cards every day, or you are just coming back from a break, or you decide to refresh your
        knowledge after years. We call it maximum gain repetition.

    <div class="sparesys-title">Public courses - Private copies</div>

    <div>
        You create your own stacks of cards just for yourself. If you feel like it,
        you can make them publically accessible. When you enroll in a public course, you
        work on your local copy, where you can add cards or edit them as you wish.

    <div class="sparesys-title">Rememberators learn about your learning</div>

    <div>
        Some things are easier to remember than others. Why waste time repeating things often
        that are easy to remember anyway? Rememberators keep track on what
        people remember easily and asks these cards less often.

<div class="sparesys-header">

    <div class="sparesys-title">Rememberators let you set priorities</div>

    <div>
        Some things are more important to remember than others. You can tell the Rememberators
        what is essential for you to know and they will make sure that you won't forget those.
    </div>
</div>


<div class="sparesys-title">You schedule your learning</div>
<div>
    You have to know your stack at a certain date? Tell the Rememberators, and they will optimize
    your learning so that you succeed.
