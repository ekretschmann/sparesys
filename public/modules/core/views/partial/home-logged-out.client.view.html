            Of course it is, but you don't have to be one to use Rememberators. Kids are the people, who spend much of
            their time learning, so we are trying to make this site as attractive as possible for them. If you are
            grown up or the games and animations get into your way, you will be able to switch them off.

        Spaced repetition tools are great, but they expect you to do your chores every day.
        Remembarators does not have this unrealistic expectation and adapts to you and your learning style,
        whether you repeat your cards every day, or you are just coming back from a break, or you decide to refresh your
        knowledge after years. We call it maximum gain repetition.

    <div class="sparesys-title">Public courses - Private copies</div>

    <div>
        You create your own stacks of cards just for yourself. If you feel like it,
        you can make them publically accessible. When you enroll in a public course, you
        work on your local copy, where you can add cards or edit them as you wish.

        Some things are easier to remember than others. Why waste time repeating things often
        that are easy to remember anyway? Rememberators keep track on what
        people remember easily and asks these cards less often.

    Rememberators are still is in their alpha stage. We have a number of users now and will include
    their feedback in future versions of the application. The application is open for early adopters, but
    at this stage we are after organic growth and are not advertising the application for a
    wide audience. But stay tuned, a beta release is planned for early 2015.
