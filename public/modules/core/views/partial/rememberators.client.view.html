                Gator Skater is the most active Rememberator. He whizzes
                around on his skates and goes through the courses like
                a flash. You are not like him? Don't worry! Rememberators
                adapts to your personal learning style.

                Illuminator is a careful creature. She wants to know things
                in depth and dives down deep to get to the bottom of things.
                Are you like her?

            <infobox logo="woman" title="Hibernator" position="left">
                Hibernator has her ups and downs. In summer, she works really
                hard and takes a bit of a break in winter. When she starts again
                after having had a snooze, Rememberators helps her with getting back
                to speed in no time.
