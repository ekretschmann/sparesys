                Rememberators organise teaching in schools and classes. If you just want to coach your own
                children, you simply become a teacher of your own private school. Register as school admin and
                teacher in the <a href="" data-ng-click="settingsPopup()">settings</a> and
                follow the instructions to set yourself up to teach your children.
