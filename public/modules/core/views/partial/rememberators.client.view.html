                â€œThey call me the Gator Skater! I am the most active
                Rememberator. I just love whizzing around on my skates
                and racing through courses like a breeze. Are you like me?
                It doesn't matter whether you are or not, because Rememberators
                is cool enough to adapt to your own learning style."

                lightbulb! I want to know about everything in depth and, when something interests me a lot, I dive down deep to get to the
                bottom of things."

                hard in the summer, but tend to take a break in the winter. Once
                I wake up from my cosy snooze, Rememberators helps me get
