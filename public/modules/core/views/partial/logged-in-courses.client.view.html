            New to Rememberators? I see, that you haven't got any courses, yet.
            Whatever you learn on Rememberators is put into courses. Courses help you to
            keep the subjects you learn separated so that you can concentrate on one thing
            at a time. So here is how to you get your courses:
        </infobox>

        <infobox logo="girl" position="left">
            Superheros sometimes <a href="#!/courses/create">create their own courses</a>. This is great
            when you have
            something special that you find interesting. Why not have your very own
            course on horse breeds or facts about your favorite football stars? Once you
            have created a course you can decide to publish it and share it with others here
            on Rememberators - or you can keep it for yourself forever. Use the Courses
            Menu to get going!
        </infobox>

            Well, well, well. If everybody starts sharing, there will
            be plenty of courses to choose from. You can use the Courses Menu to
            have a look at what is there already
            and <a href="#!/courses/search">search for courses</a> of things you are interested in. Once
            you subscribe
            to a course it turns into your own course - so you are free to change it in
            any way that you like. You can turn it into exactly what you want it be!

            Rememberators are also great for your teachers. They let them put courses together for
            you and help you learn your facts. This way, they can spot what you are working on
            and give you all the support that you need to succeed. If your school works with the
            Rememberators, you can use the courses menu to <a
                href="#!/schools/subscribe/student">find
            your school</a> and enrol. Your teachers will then be able to assign your coursework.
